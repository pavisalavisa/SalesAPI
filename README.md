![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/pavisalavisa/SalesAPI/.NET?label=Main%20Build)

Sales API is a toy example built with .NET 5 employing clean architecture.

# Objectives
- Build a clean REST API with .NET 5 
- Focus on core technology without too many 3rd party dependencies
- Build a docker enabled solution
- Provide a series of conversation starters ranging from practices to design choices

## Tech
* [ASP.NET Core 5] - Popular web-development framework for building web apps on the .NET 
* [EF Core 5] - Modern and mature ORM for .NET
* [Fluent Validation] - .NET library for building strongly-typed validation rules
* [Swashbuckle] - OpenAPI implementations for .NET
* [Moq] - Friendly mocking framework for .NET
* [NUnit] - Unit testing framework for .NET

## Prerequisites
You should have either **.NET 5 SDK and runtime** installed along with **SQL Server** or **Docker** on your machine.

Since HTTPS redirections are used make sure to generate the self-signed certificate for development purposes and mark it as trusted. You can find more info about it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/additional-tools/self-signed-certificates-guide).
```sh
$ dotnet dev-certs https -ep $env:USERPROFILE\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p yourPassword
$ dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

## Testing
Position yourself in the `/src` directory and execute the following command:
```sh
$ dotnet test
```

## How to run
Position yourself in the `/src` directory and execute the following command:
```sh
$ dotnet run --project Api
```
The application is up and running on `localhost:4201` with swagger documentation available at `localhost:4201/swagger/index.html`.

## Docker
The sales API has Docker support
[![Docker](https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-and-brands/512/97_Docker_logo_logos-128.png)](https://www.docker.com/)

### Building an image
Position yourself in the `/src` directory and execute the following command:
```sh
$ docker image build -t sales-api -f Api\Dockerfile .
```

### How to run
It is very easy to run the application using Docker Compose.
Position yourself in the root directory of the project and execute the following command:
```sh
$ docker-compose up
```
